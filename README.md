# 1.Explored the dataset and prepared the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
# 2.Explored the relationships between different features.
# 3.Conducted clustering analysis. 
# 4.Utilized Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
# 5.Split the data into training and testing sets.
# 6.Trained the models on the training data and evaluated their performance on the testing data.
# 7.Calculated performance metrics such as RMSE and R-squared for each model.
# 8.Examined the importance of features in the Linear Regression model.
# 9.Used Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters.
# 10.Evaluated the performance cross-validation and checked for overfitting.
